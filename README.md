# PyDiffGame

`PyDiffGame` is a Python package that solves differential games for control theory implementations.
This package allows to solve equations arising in models that involve the use of differential games
for finding optimal controllers of a multi-objective system with multiple controlled objects.

## Supported Scenarios
`PyDiffGame` supports several scenarios that can arise based on the designated control law 
of the input system  and the reqired horizon to solve the system for. 

### Open Loop Infinite Horizon

### Closed Loop Infinite Horizon

### Open Loop Finite Horizon

### Closed Loop Finite Horizon
